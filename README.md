I make stuff for fun and put it on the Internet. I've been programming on and off (but mostly on) since teaching myself Python in 2019.

  ### [SpMp](https://github.com/toasterofbread/spmp)
  ```
  A YouTube Music client I've been making since August 2022.
  I've implemented useful queue manipulation features, as well as language and metadata customisation options.
  Seeing poor song title translations on a daily basis in the official app and not being able to change them was a great motivator.

  ### [RE](https://github.com/toasterofbread/RE)
  ```
  A basic 2D and 3D game engine I made as my first C++ project, including a basic voxel implementation.
  As far as the engine API goes, it's basically a remake of Godot.
  I ported this project to the PS Vita at one point, but I can't remember how to get through the dependency hell to rebuild it now.

  ### [Kakutroid](https://github.com/toasterofbread/Kakutroid)
  ```
  A Metroidvania with simple geometric graphics and Celeste-inspired movement.
  Another project I planned to finish and release but was never able to, although this got much closer than Dino.
  I will probably revisit this idea/project at some point.

  ### [Game Off 2021 entry](https://github.com/toasterofbread/Game-Off-2021)
  ```
  A project I started as an entry to the 2021 Github Game Off, involving an in-game scripting language.
  Implementing a language in GDScript was a lot harder than I had expected, but I was able to get basic logic, functions, and variables working.
  It became clear pretty quickly that I wouldn't finish it in time for submission, but it was still worth it for the experience.

  ### [Untitled Dino Game](https://github.com/toasterofbread/Untitled-Dino-Game)
  ```
  A simple p2p infinite runner game I made in Godot in about a week.
  This was the first project I started with the intent to actually complete and release it.
  My motivation for the runner idea didn't last for very long though.

  ### [Metroid in Godot (again)](https://github.com/toasterofbread/godot-metroid-engine)
  ```
  My third (and so far most recent) crack at a 2D Metroid game in Godot.
  This time I actually completed all of Samus's mechanics (including grapple and spider).
  Then I moved on to fun things like menu UI, levels, and enemies.

  The second attempt died after a single week because I spent hours thinking about the story instead of planning the software.

### 2020

  ### [Super Metroid in Godot](https://github.com/toasterofbread/original-metroid-engine)
  ```
  A remake of Super Metroid's Samus using the original assets.
  The first project I created with the Godot Engine over the course of about two weeks in summer 2020.
  All the basic movement mechanics from Super are implemented, except the grapple beam.
  Metroid projects are a running theme for me, apparently.

  ### [MultiBot](https://github.com/toasterofbread/Multi-Bot-Rewrite)
  ```
  A multi-purpose Discord bot I built after practicing with smaller bot projects in 2019.
  Has a variety of features including timetables, weather, and music playback.
  ```

### 2019

##### - Various Python Discord bots
##### - Python command-line calculator
